  "body": "# Welcome to cosmos\r\n\r\nCosmos is a set of tools for \"Video Astronomy\" with the Raspberry Pi. Currently the main tool is 'cosmos' itself, which is a basic image capture application.\r\n\r\n## cosmos app\r\n\r\nThe cosmos app implements a very bare set of features, the philosphy\r\nof the app is to be an image provider to other applications for\r\nfurther processing (like Mathematica.) A lot of the defaults are\r\ndesigned around what's \"normal\" for the Raspberry Pi running Raspbian\r\n(e.g paths)\r\n\r\nWhen the application is running you can:\r\n- press space to bring up the on-screen menus\r\n- use the up and down keys to scroll through the controls\r\n- use the left and right keys to change the controls\r\n- if you turn on SHARE IMAGE it will save a snapshot of the current view to /run/shm/cosmos.png every second. This feature is now on by default.\r\n- Pressing 's' will save a PNG snapshot into $HOME/Pictures.\r\n- Pressing 'c' will draw crosshairs on display\r\n\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous \r\n\r\n### Mathematica Library\r\n\r\nAlso included is a very basic Mathematica Module to import the image and to detect and hilight stars.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGet[\"/path/to/cosmos/extras/mathematica/VideoAstronomy.m\"]\r\n\r\n# grab a frame\r\nMyFrame = CosmosImage[]\r\n\r\n# highlight detected stars\r\nHighlightStars[MyFrame]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Nginx snippet\r\n\r\nalso included is a very basic 3 line include for nginx that create an alias for /cosmos.png to /run/shm/cosmos.png\r\n\r\n### set_pal.sh\r\n\r\nA quick one-liner to set the first image capture device to PAL mode -\r\ndesigned for usage with the Revolution Imager device which outputs PAL\r\nvideo by default.\r\n",
